Accounts had the ability to change their own status to anything from a visitor, student, or casual staff member, to an Emeritus Professor.\\nThe portal is a platform through which work and service requests are supposed to be submitted. In a statement to Honi, a University spokesperson said that students were \\nIt is unclear whether should therefore have only access to the tab of the portal. \\\" \\nService Requests\\nAlmost a million 'archived' service requests and nearly 90,000 'active' service requests, dating from 1999 to 2021, were accessible through the portal. These included requests for campus security, guarding services, security patrol requests, security risk assessments, barricading services, and standard maintenance requests. The database was searchable by entry, issue type, location, status and requester.\\nThe nature, status, and date of submission were accessible for every lodged work request through the \\\"Service Request ID\\\" search prompt. Service Request IDs could then be filtered by category and sorted by date to provide the user with a more complete picture.\\nHoni was able to access the sub-category and date of request for over 2,000 entries relating to security services under the 'active' work requests, and over 60,000 entries with information pertaining to the staff making work requests.\\nFloor plans\\nDetailed interactive floor plans for 1,335 University buildings and properties were accessible. The plans included illustrations of building facilities, classrooms, offices, rooftops, basements and service areas, as well as building coordinates and notes on maintenance access and keys required to unlock maintenance doors. The accessible data extended to every USyd campus, as well as regional and interstate properties and research facilities owned and managed by the University.\\nInterior floor plans ranged from corridors within the Quadrangle to ensuite bathrooms in the top floors of the F23 Administration Building, complete with architectural depictions of urinals. Square meterage was provided of rooms from open-plan offices to storage cupboards and toilets. Building sizes and usable floor areas were provided down to the square centimetre.\\nThe bathrooms of F23\\nStaff information\\nUnder a 'Find a staff member' tab, room locations of thousands of University staff members were accessible, as well as contact details for some. Selecting particular rooms and offices on digital floor plans provided the numbers and names of both academic and professional University staff assigned to them, sortable by Department or School. Occupancy information under a 'Highlight rooms by department' tab listed monthly non-utility room charges per Department by floor. Charges ran into the tens of thousands of dollars for some locations.\\nThe database's ease of accessibility to students, and subsequent removal of student access, raises questions over the University's handling of information. The University's use of software such as Dataminr and ProctorU has previously raised concerns about data management at the University.\",\n          \"housands flood Sydney's CBD for Women's March 4 Justice\\nThough 10,000 people showed up, the protest was criticised for its lack of First Nations engagement.\\nFollowing a wave of sexual assault allegations against the country's most powerful men, thousands flooded Sydney's CBD on Monday afternoon to demand that Parliament take action and accountability.\\nThe crowd of around 10,000 people packed the streets of Town Hall, carrying placards sentiments such as and \\\"Smash the patriarchy.\\\"\\nAround 10,000 people attended the rally.\\nSpeakers voiced their anger, frustration, and determination to seek justice for survivors of gendered violence. \\\" \\nAboriginal Elder Aunty Shirley gave a Welcome to Country and described the systemic mistreatment of Aboriginal women as \\\"less than human beings\\\" since colonisation, that, \\nDunghutti woman Marie Barbaric also shared her lived experience as a victim of sex-trafficking as a child and the need for the government to \\nAfter the main demonstration, the crowd marched across Hyde Park and regrouped in front of NSW Parliament House.
